### v6.1.0 (2022-01-11)

* Removed context-less timer hop from transaction state test.

  The context-less timer hope was not specific to koa execution. With the upcoming AsyncLocal implementation there are new limitations to boundaries we can track promises that cause this to fail. Given this setup is not specific to koa functionality, modifying to remove.

  no active transaction.

  Thank you to @jgeurts for the contribution!

* Added Node 14 testing to CI.

  Thank you to @jgeurts for the contribution!

* Added repository property to package.json.
* Limited koa-router and @koa/router tests to below versions with known naming issues (8.0.3+).
* Modified router-instrumentation.js to fully conform with linting rules.

### 3.0.0 (2019-10-18):
* add @koa/router instrumentation

  Thanks to @zacanger for this contribution.

* **BREAKING** Removed support for Node 6, 7, and 9.

  The minimum supported version is now Node v8. For further information on our support policy, see: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent.

* Added support for Node v12.

* Bumps `tap` to latest major version.

### 2.0.0 (2019-05-21):

* `koa-router` instrumentation now names transactions after the internal `koa-router` matched route. In the case of multiple matches, the last matched route that can serve requests is used.

* Added `allowedMethods` middleware coverage.

* Fixed issue where `koa` middleware instrumentation did not accurately track `next` method. This could impact custom transaction naming and router framework naming, in certain situations.

### 1.0.8 (2019-01-07):

* Bumped `@newrelic/test-utilities` dependency to v3.0.0.

### 1.0.7 (2018-11-5):

* Adds support for naming transactions without setting the `context.body` property.

* Added missing instrumentation hooks when module imported directly.

* Upgraded dev dependencies.

### 1.0.6 (2018-09-12):

* Fixed coveralls link in readme to point at default branch.

* Removed testing on Node 4 and 5 for Koa and dependent modules.

  Koa versions that supported Node 4 and 5 had an open dependency on `debug`
  (e.g. `"debug": "*"`). The latest major version of `debug` no longer works on
  Node <6 thus rendering these older versions of Koa unusable on Node <6 as well.

### 1.0.5 (2018-04-12):

* Upgraded `newrelic` peerDep semver to allow newest major version.

  Thanks @cesine for the PR!

### 1.0.4 (2018-04-11):

* Moved `methods` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`.

  This fixes an error caused by an oversight in the last release, which included `methods` used as a core dep.

### 1.0.3 (2018-04-10):

* Added support for the `koa-route` routing module.

  Transactions will now be correctly named when routing using the `koa-route`
  module.  Huge thanks to @shumsky for the contribution!

### 1.0.2 (2018-03-22):

* Added check against `Koa.prototype` before instrumenting.

  This ensures that we aren't wrapping versions below 2.0, which would break once middleware
  are executed.

### 1.0.1 (2018-03-15):

* Updated instrumentation to hook into `context.response._body` instead of
  `context.body`.

  This ensures delegation is not overridden regardless of whether users define
  the body directly on `ctx`, or on `ctx.response`. Thanks @qventura for the investigation!
